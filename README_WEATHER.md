# Weather Integration for Demand Forecasting

This document describes the implementation of weather data integration into the demand forecasting application, allowing for weather-adjusted forecasts and correlation analysis.

## Overview

The weather integration feature adds a new dimension to demand forecasting by considering how weather conditions affect consumer purchasing patterns. The implementation includes:

1. **Weather data fetching** from OpenMeteo API
2. **Weather visualization** with historical data and forecasts
3. **Weather impact calculation** on demand forecasts
4. **Correlation analysis** between weather factors and sales

## Components

### 1. Weather Client (`weather_client.py`)

A client for the OpenMeteo API with the following functionality:
- Fetches historical weather data
- Retrieves weather forecasts
- Calculates weather impact factors for demand
- Analyzes correlations between weather and demand

Key methods:
- `fetch_historical_weather()`: Gets historical weather for a location
- `fetch_forecast()`: Gets weather forecast for a location
- `get_weather_impact_factors()`: Calculates impact of weather on demand
- `analyze_weather_demand_correlation()`: Correlates weather with historical demand
- `forecast_with_weather_adjustment()`: Adjusts forecasts based on weather

### 2. Weather Visualizer (`weather_visualizer.py`)

Creates visualizations showing weather data and its impact on demand:
- Weather overview with temperature, precipitation, and impact factors
- Weather-demand correlation visualizations
- Weather-adjusted forecast comparison plots
- Weather impact summary statistics

Key methods:
- `create_weather_overview()`: Weather conditions visualization
- `create_weather_demand_correlation()`: Correlation analysis visualizations
- `create_weather_adjusted_forecast()`: Comparison of base and weather-adjusted forecasts
- `create_weather_impact_summary()`: Impact factor analysis

### 3. Forecast App with Weather (`forecast_app_with_weather.py`)

Enhanced Dash application that adds two new tabs to the existing interface:
- **Weather Analysis**: Displays weather conditions and impact on forecasts
- **Weather-Demand Correlation**: Shows correlation between weather factors and demand

## Usage

The application can be started with:

```
python run_weather_app.py
```

The interface provides the following weather-related features:

1. **Weather Analysis Tab**
   - Displays temperature and precipitation forecast
   - Shows weather impact factors
   - Compares base forecast with weather-adjusted forecast
   - Explains how different weather conditions affect demand

2. **Weather-Demand Correlation Tab**
   - Shows correlation coefficients between weather metrics and demand
   - Presents scatter plots of the strongest correlations
   - Provides time series analysis of weather impact vs. actual demand
   - Includes detailed explanation of correlation analysis

## Weather Impact Factors

The system calculates the following impact factors:

- **Temperature Impact**: Higher temperatures generally increase demand for frozen foods
- **Rain Impact**: Rainy days increase delivery and frozen food orders
- **Snow Impact**: Snowfall strongly increases frozen food purchases (stocking up effect)
- **Wind Impact**: Very windy days may slightly decrease in-person shopping trips

These factors are combined to create an overall weather impact factor that adjusts demand forecasts.

## Statistical Analysis

The correlation analysis provides:
- Correlation coefficients between weather metrics and demand
- Significance indicators (strong, moderate, weak correlation)
- Visual representation of relationships
- Time series comparison of weather impact and actual demand

## Implementation Notes

1. All weather data is cached to minimize API calls
2. Default location is configurable (currently set to New York)
3. Weather impact calculations use simplified models that can be refined with more data
4. The system automatically selects the most correlated weather factor for primary analysis

## Recent Fixes

The following improvements were made to enhance reliability and robustness:

1. **Date Format Handling**: 
   - Fixed issues with the OpenMeteo historical API date format
   - Added validation to ensure only past dates are used with the historical API
   - Implemented fallback to safe date ranges when system clock issues are detected

2. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Added array length validation for API responses
   - Implemented graceful handling of mismatched array lengths
   - Functions now return empty DataFrames instead of raising exceptions

3. **System Date Protection**:
   - Added detection for future system dates (beyond 2024)
   - Implemented fallback to known good date ranges (2023)
   - Added detailed logging for date validation and adjustment

These fixes ensure the weather integration functions correctly even when there are API issues or system clock problems.
